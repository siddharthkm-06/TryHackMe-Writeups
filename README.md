# TryHackMe-Writeups
Collection of TryHackMe room writeups and solutions
This repository contains my collection of TryHackMe room writeups.  
The purpose is to document my learning and provide a reference for cybersecurity concepts and challenges.

## Structure
- Each room has its own folder named after the room.
- Inside each folder, you'll find a `readme.md` containing the writeup for that room.
